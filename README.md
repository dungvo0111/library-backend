### Description
A responsive library web app where visitors can search books by ISBN or filter them by title, author, status and genres. Also, they can look for the authors.

The library allows signing in with Google accounts. Otherwise, visitors have to sign up manually before being able to sign in with their registered accounts.

Signed-in users have the right to borrow and return books from the library.

Admin user can add, update, or remove books and authors. 

This is my individual project accomplished at Integrify.
